# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each released version records the SHA-256 of its HTML artifact, so this file doubles as a historical hash record. A hash listed here should match the `.sha256` in the corresponding GitHub release and the CI build attestation.

## [Unreleased]

Specification and documentation only. No application code yet.

### Added — spec v0.3 (2026-08-02)

- Hardware wallet companion role as the project's primary framing (§14a): device registry, fingerprint and receive-address verification, vendor support matrix, Seed XOR, multisig quorum survivability analysis
- Entropy Health Meter on every secret-creation screen — measures min-entropy rather than Shannon, shows claimed vs measured bits side by side, blocks generation below target, and refuses to give false-precision numbers for human-chosen passphrases
- codex32 (BIP-93) backup format — Shamir shares verifiable by hand with pen and paper
- BIP-329 wallet label import and export for portability with Sparrow, Nunchuk, BitBoxApp, and BTCPay
- Plain-English Help system at three depth levels, single-sourced with `docs/`
- Open source release engineering: reproducible builds, CI attestation, GPG signing, no hosted version
- Multi-currency support via CoinGecko `vs_currency` plus Frankfurter for fiat-to-fiat
- Historical price backfill with three modes, defaulting to manual entry
- Keyfile second factor, off by default
- Vault recovery shares: format reserved in Phase 0, feature shipped in Phase 2
- File hasher with no size ceiling: streaming, single-pass multi-algorithm, recursive folder hashing, interoperable manifests, and backup-media bit-rot verification
- Emerging standards survey with adoption decisions (§19), including an honest quantum readiness position
- Documentation structure and ADR practice

### Removed

- Duress/decoy compartment. Weak deniability against anyone who knows the file format, and it doubles the ways to lose data permanently
- QuickHash binaries (28 MB across three platforms), replaced by the built-in hasher

### Added — spec v0.2 (2026-08-02)

- Two-realm architecture: sandboxed cold realm with `connect-src 'none'` alongside a network-capable warm shell. Resolves the conflict between "tools must work online" and "secrets must never leak"
- Vault compartments — public and secret — so the portfolio works online while seeds stay sealed
- Portfolio manager: transactions, lots, FIFO/LIFO/HIFO/average/spec-ID cost basis, realized and unrealized PnL
- Price aggregation across five browser-callable sources, using median rather than mean
- On-chain balance lookups, opt-in per address, with the privacy cost stated plainly
- Notes and tags across every entity, with public/secret visibility
- Four-level concealment: masking, privacy blur, panic hide, hidden items
- Chain coverage expanded to 35+ with coin types verified against the live SLIP-44 registry

### Added — spec v0.1 (2026-08-02)

- Initial specification: single-file design, airgap enforcement, vault format, module breakdown, threat model, portability contract
