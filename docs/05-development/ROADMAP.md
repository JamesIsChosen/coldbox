# Roadmap

**This file is the single source of truth for what to build next _and_ for current status.** It is machine-readable by convention: work the first unchecked item whose dependencies are all complete.

Status: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` complete
Markers: `👤 human-required` — an agent cannot complete it (physical hardware, or a decision that isn't theirs)
· `⚠️` — agent-implementable, but something is needed from the human before it fully works
· `🌐` — has acceptance criteria only a browser can verify; use the P0.3a harness and mark `[~]` until it confirms them

**An item whose criteria you cannot verify is `[~]`, never `[x]`.** Nine Phase 0 items have browser-dependent criteria; the P0.3a harness makes eight of them agent-verifiable. The ninth, P0.19, needs real devices and always will.

Every PR must update this file in the same commit as the work it completes.

**Do not duplicate item-level status anywhere else** — not in the README, not in the spec, not in a PR description. Duplicated status drifts, and stale status is worse than none because people trust it. Other documents link here.

## How to pick the next item

1. Read top to bottom.
2. Find the first `[ ]` item whose listed dependencies are all `[x]`.
3. If it's already `[~]`, check for an open PR or branch before starting — someone may be on it.
4. Do **that item only**. One roadmap item per PR.
5. If the item is ambiguous or the spec doesn't settle a design question it raises, **stop and open a question issue or an ADR proposal rather than guessing.** Guessing on a security boundary is worse than a delay.

Do not skip ahead to a later phase because it looks more interesting. Ordering encodes dependency, and Phase 0 in particular is load-bearing for everything above it.

**Working several items in one unattended session?** That's a batch run — see [batch-run.md](batch-run.md). It adds dependency-aware branching, a self-review gate between items, a maximum unmerged stack depth, and hard stop conditions.

**Getting through the whole roadmap** is a *campaign*: repeated batches with merges between them. Merging resets the stack depth, so how often you merge — not agent capability — sets the pace.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

Nothing above this phase is safe to build until the container is trustworthy.

### Build and verification pipeline

- [x] **P0.1 — Deterministic build skeleton**
  *Deps: none*
  `package.json`, `.nvmrc`, and a build script assembling `src/` into a single `build/coldbox.html`. No app features yet — an empty shell is fine.
  **Accept:** two consecutive clean builds produce byte-identical output; `build/coldbox.html.sha256` emitted; `LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC` enforced; no timestamps, machine paths, or unsorted iteration in output.

- [x] **P0.2 — Vendor layout and verification**
  *Deps: P0.1*
  `vendor/` structure, `npm run verify-vendor` re-downloading upstream releases and comparing hashes, `dependencies.md` populated with real versions and hashes for `@noble/*` and `@scure/*`.
  **Accept:** `verify-vendor` passes; a deliberately corrupted vendor file makes it fail; the build refuses to run if verification fails.

- [x] **P0.3 — Forbidden-construct lint**
  *Deps: P0.1*
  Build-time check rejecting `eval`, `new Function`, `import`, `require`, external URLs, and `localStorage` in secret-handling paths.
  **Accept:** lint runs in the build and fails it; a test fixture containing each construct is rejected.

- [x] **P0.3a — Headless browser harness** 🌐 *unblocks browser verification for eight later items*
  *Deps: P0.1*
  Playwright as a **dev dependency** (never shipped), loading `build/coldbox.html` over `file://` in headless Chromium and Firefox. Exposes reusable assertions used by every later item's browser criteria:
  `expectNoConsoleErrors()` · `expectNoCspViolations()` · `expectCspViolation(directive)` · `expectScriptRejected()` (after post-build byte tampering) · `expectNetworkPrimitiveBlocked(name)` inside a frame · `expectParentCannotReadFrame()` · `expectElementVisible(sel)` · `atViewport(w, h)`.
  Rationale in [ADR-0007](adr/0007-headless-browser-harness.md).
  **Accept:** After a clean `npm ci` and the documented `npx playwright install chromium firefox` prerequisite, `npm run test:browser` loads the built file over `file://` in both engines; a deliberately CSP-violating fixture is detected; a byte-tampered inline script is rejected by the browser and the harness reports it; harness failures exit **non-zero**; Playwright appears only under `devDependencies` and contributes **0 bytes** to `build/coldbox.html`.

- [x] **P0.4 — CSP hash-pinning in the build**
  *Deps: P0.1 (implementation) · P0.3a (verification)*
  Compute SHA-256 of each inline script and style block; inject into the respective `script-src`/`style-src` directives.
  **Accept:** built file runs with no CSP violations; altering one byte of the inline script post-build causes the browser to refuse to execute it.
  🌐 *Both criteria are verified against the built artifact by the P0.3a harness in Chromium and Firefox. Implementation may land first and sit at `[~]` until the harness confirms them.*

### The two realms

- [x] **P0.5 — Warm shell skeleton**
  *Deps: P0.4*
  Outer document, CSP per [csp-policy.md](../02-security/csp-policy.md), nav rail and mobile tab bar, routing, dark/light. No features.
  **Accept:** loads from `file://` on the full device matrix; no console errors; responsive from 360 px to desktop.
  🌐 *Verified by the P0.3a harness in headless Chromium and Firefox. Real-device confirmation is P0.19.*

- [x] **P0.6 — Cold realm bootstrap**
  *Deps: P0.5*
  `srcdoc` iframe with `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-downloads"` and its own CSP including `connect-src 'none'`.
  **Accept:** iframe instantiates; `fetch`, `XHR`, and `WebSocket` inside it **throw**; warm shell cannot read its DOM or variables; **app fails closed with an explanation if the iframe cannot be established.**
  🌐 *Verified by the P0.3a harness in headless Chromium and Firefox — this is the project's central security claim, so the harness assertions for it are the most important tests in the repo. Real-device confirmation is P0.19.*

- [x] **P0.7 — MessageChannel handshake and schema validator**
  *Deps: P0.6*
  Handshake transferring a port; typed whitelist schema per [architecture.md](../01-spec/architecture.md); global `message` handler ignored after handshake.
  **Accept:** schema rejects unknown types and strips unknown fields; a test asserts **no message type can carry a mnemonic, private key, xprv, passphrase, or secret-compartment plaintext**; messages injected on the global handler post-handshake are discarded and logged.
  🌐 *Verified by the P0.3a harness in headless Chromium and Firefox. Real-device confirmation is P0.19.*

- [x] **P0.8 — CSP canary and airgap guard**
  *Deps: P0.7*
  Deliberate exact-URL policy-violating requests as warm and cold canaries; `navigator.onLine` and `connection` signals; checking/green/amber/red banner states; prototype-safe runtime neutering of network primitives inside the cold realm.
  **Accept:** both exact canaries fire independently; warm-only, cold-only, and both-policy CSP stripping go to full lockdown and refuse vault operations; banner reflects actual network state within 5 s.
  🌐 *Verified by the P0.3a harness in headless Chromium and Firefox, including Playwright offline emulation, asymmetric/both-policy CSP lockdown, exact canary URL checks, prototype restoration checks, and all five cold-realm network primitives. Real-device confirmation is P0.19.*

- [x] **P0.9 — Capability self-check panel**
  *Deps: P0.8*
  Boot-time detection of `getRandomValues`, `crypto.subtle`, WASM, Workers, camera, and available save paths.
  **Accept:** accurate on every platform in the device matrix; **hard-fails with an explanation if `getRandomValues` is absent**, never substituting `Math.random`.
  🌐 *Verified by the P0.3a harness in headless Chromium and Firefox, including the missing-`getRandomValues` lockdown fixture. Safari and mobile accuracy is confirmed at P0.19 — no real-device platform result is inferred here.*

### Cryptography and vault

- [x] **P0.10 — Crypto layer**
  *Deps: P0.9*
  Pure-JS `@noble` as the default path; WebCrypto used only after an affirmative known-answer test; Argon2id WASM loading.
  **Accept:** RFC 9106 Argon2 vectors and NIST AES-GCM vectors pass on both paths; **vault details display which KDF is actually active**, so a silent PBKDF2 fallback is impossible.
  🌐 *Verified by independent Node vectors plus the Chromium/Firefox browser harness; device-specific KDF allocation behavior remains part of P0.19.*

- [x] **P0.11 — Vault format v1**
  *Deps: P0.10*
  Serializer and parser per [vault-format.md](../01-spec/vault-format.md): header, AAD, multi-record wrapped-DEK block, two compartments, HKDF subkeys, 64 KiB padding.
  **Accept:** round-trips; tampering with any header byte fails authentication; wrong passphrase and corrupted file are indistinguishable in the error; padding always lands on a 64 KiB boundary; **the secret subkey has no derivation path reachable while online.**
  🌐 *Verified by real P0.10-backed Node round-trips, all-header-byte tamper tests, generic authentication failures, and the Chromium/Firefox cold-only API boundary; physical vault workflows remain part of P0.19.*

- [x] **P0.12 — KDF profiles and benchmark**
  *Deps: P0.11*
  Fast/Standard/Paranoid profiles, stored in the header, with an on-device timing benchmark offered before vault creation.
  **Accept:** all three profiles round-trip; benchmark reports realistic timings; Paranoid warns about iOS allocation failure.
  🌐 *Verified by real profile round-trips, sequential on-device benchmark timings, a likely-iOS allocation guard, and the cold-only browser offer; physical-device timing remains part of P0.19.*

- [~] **P0.13 — Lock, unlock, save, load**
  *Deps: P0.12*
  Three save paths (File System Access, blob download, manual base64/QR); symmetric load; idle auto-lock; `Esc Esc` panic hide.
  **Accept:** at least one save path works on every device-matrix platform; **the manual base64 path is a complete, usable flow on iOS Safari**, not a stub.
  🌐 *Harness verifies the blob and manual paths in Chromium/Firefox, including a create → save → lock → manual-load → unlock round-trip. **The iOS Safari claim cannot be verified without an iPhone** — leave it unverified until P0.19.*

- [ ] **P0.14 — Save integrity**
  *Deps: P0.13*
  Verify-after-save re-opening the written file before clearing the dirty flag; generational filenames; rollback detection via save counter.
  **Accept:** a deliberately truncated save is caught before the dirty flag clears; opening an older vault warns with both dates and counters.

- [ ] **P0.15 — Keyfile unlock**
  *Deps: P0.14*
  Wrapped-DEK method 2. Off by default, with an unmissable warning that a lost or byte-altered keyfile means permanent loss.
  **Accept:** unlocks with the correct keyfile; fails with a one-byte-altered keyfile; passphrase-only vaults are unaffected.

### Trust surface

- [ ] **P0.16 — Provenance panel and self-hash verifier**
  *Deps: P0.15*
  Every embedded library with version and upstream hash; the full CSP allowlist; build date; expected hash; drag-and-drop self-hash drop zone.
  **Accept:** listed hashes match `dependencies.md`; **the drop zone states plainly that self-verification is circular** and points to [verification.md](../02-security/verification.md).
  🌐 *Drop-zone behaviour verified by the P0.3a harness via file upload emulation.*

- [ ] **P0.17 — Help framework**
  *Deps: P0.5*
  Three-depth content model; build-time compilation of `docs/00-overview/glossary.md` and `docs/03-guides/`; contextual `?`; inline glossary; offline search.
  **Accept:** all three depths render and switch; a documented feature missing a depth block produces a build warning; search works with no network.
  🌐 *Rendering and depth switching verified by the P0.3a harness.*

- [ ] **P0.18 — CI** ⚠️ *needs repository secrets configured by the human before the attestation step works*
  *Deps: P0.16, P0.17*
  GitHub Actions: build, test, `verify-vendor`, lint, **double-build hash comparison**, second-OS build comparison, bundle size report, release attestation. Plus the documentation checks in [doc-hygiene.md](doc-hygiene.md): internal link resolution, review dates present and within max age, three-depth help blocks, doc index consistency, roadmap ID references, and `dependencies.md` matching `vendor-manifest.json`.
  **Accept:** CI hash matches a local build; a nondeterministic change fails CI; a broken internal link fails CI; a missing review date fails CI; an out-of-date review date warns.

- [ ] **P0.19 — Device matrix pass** 👤 **human-required**
  *Deps: P0.18*
  Full manual pass per [testing.md](testing.md) across all eight platforms.
  **Accept:** every platform passes the seven per-platform checks; results recorded in the PR packet. **iOS Safari is tested first, not last.**
  Requires physically opening the file on real devices. An agent must not mark this complete, and must not infer a platform's result from a similar one.

## Changing this file

Adding, reordering, or removing items is a design decision. Small clarifications are fine in any PR. Anything that changes **what gets built or in what order** needs an issue or an ADR first — the ordering is the plan, and quietly rewriting it defeats the point of having one.
